About Me

Hey there, thanks for checking out my little website. I'm a 24 year old student
studying computer science at KU Leuven. I am currently working on my thesis in
computer graphics.

When I'm not looking at monospaced fonts to make computers do my bidding. I
draw and build imaginary worlds or fiddle around with small electronics.
